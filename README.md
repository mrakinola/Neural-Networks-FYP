# Neural-Networks-FYP
FInal Year Project (FYP)
Using the Python Library TensorFlow, Artificial Neural Networks was utilised along with Convolutional Neural Networks. 
This respository will contain different configurations of neural networks.
They will be tried and tested in an attempt to improve the accuracy and reduce the loss.
