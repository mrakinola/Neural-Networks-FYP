# Neural-Networks-FYP
FInal Year Project for University (FYP) 
Deep Learning is a vast field, containing many subcategories and various applications, such as 
machine vision which is basal in many Engineering applications of today. Convolutional Neural 
Networks, the leading architecture for image classification, was analysed in depth with a number of 
configurations to see how the models differed in performance with diverse implemented 
techniques, such as adding Dropout, Weight Decay along with Batch Normalization and Data 
Augmentation. A Multi-Layer Perceptron model was also used as a reference to view how the 
architecture overall functions differently. The models were fitted for 100 Epochs on the CIFAR-10 
dataset and evaluated with their collated metrics, Classification Accuracy, Categorical Cross-Entropy 
Loss and Root Mean Squared Error. The models were measured against each other using techniques 
such as the 5 number-summary with plots of their graphs and Confusion Matrices.


This respository will be using using the Python Library TensorFlow via Google Colab to create the different configurations of the different neural networks.
They will be tried and tested multiple times in an attempt to improve the accuracy and reduce the loss. All of the data will be gathered and used within the report
