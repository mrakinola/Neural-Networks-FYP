# Neural-Networks-FYP
FInal Year Project (FYP) for University.

## Brief Abstract from the report
**Deep Learning is a vast field, containing many subcategories and various applications, such as 
machine vision which is basal in many Engineering applications of today. Convolutional Neural 
Networks, the leading architecture for image classification, was analysed in depth with a number of 
configurations to see how the models differed in performance with diverse implemented 
techniques, such as adding Dropout, Weight Decay along with Batch Normalization and Data 
Augmentation. A Multi-Layer Perceptron model was also used as a reference to view how the 
architecture overall functions differently. The models were fitted for 100 Epochs on the CIFAR-10 
dataset and evaluated with their collated metrics, Classification Accuracy, Categorical Cross-Entropy 
Loss and Root Mean Squared Error. The models were measured against each other using techniques 
such as the 5 number-summary with plots of their graphs and Confusion Matrices.**

## Summary of findings
**The results were discussed, where Data Augmentation was deduced to have the largest regularizing effect, increasing 
Accuracy, and decreasing overfitting significantly more than the other techniques and Weight Decay
having the least effect. The report validated the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in image 
classification, along with verifying which combinations are deemed as effective and the potential for 
increased evolution and application in novel areas.**

## What this repository will consist of
**This respository will be using the TensorFlow framework, a library within the Python Programming language, where both a Deep 
Neural Network or also known as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a CNN with different configurations will be generated to 
classify coloured images for object recognition from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct classes, 
consisting of 50,000 training images (split 80:20 or 40,000:10,000 for training:validation images) along with 10,000 images for testing.**

**CIFAR-10 is 
a well-recognised dataset that is extensively employed for benchmarking computer vision algorithms
in machine learning. The field is promising, and the results could help confirm which scenarios CNNs 
thrive in and how it can be used in engineering practices and applications, along with its shortfalls 
and where improvement is needed. The usage of a MLP is for comparison, to see how advanced the 
CNN architecture is to other Neural Networks in this task. All of the data will be gathered and used within the report.**
